# Banking System - Final Project 
## Authors: DaQuawn Edwards, Andrea Kim, Shivani Tijare, Yejin Yang (Group 13)

## Repository Contents:
Each group memember had a folder containing the assignment to build their versions of the implementation of the banking system. They are not fully complete, they include our drafts of the Banking System implementation levels. Levels were either built individually or duing collaborative group sessions, and the most optimal method of implementation was chosen.

The `Final_Implementation` folder contains our final version of the baking system in `banking_system_impl.py` that should be considered the full implementation of all four levels for the final project.
